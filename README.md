# COVID-19-analysis
Covid-19 impacts analysis using python.

The first wave of covid-19 impacted the global economy as the world was never ready for the pandemic. It resulted in a rise in cases, a rise in deaths, a rise in unemployment and a rise in poverty, resulting in an economic slowdown. Here, I am required to analyze the spread of Covid-19 cases and all the impacts of covid-19 on the economy.
The dataset I was using to analyze the impacts of covid-19 is downloaded from Kaggle. It contains data about:

* the country code
* name of all the countries
* date of the record
* Human development index of all the countries
* Daily covid-19 cases
* Daily deaths due to covid-19
* stringency index of the countries
* the population of the countries
* GDP per capita of the countries

# Tools used;
* Jupyter Notebook

In this task, I studied the spread of covid-19 among the countries and its impact on the global economy. I saw that the outbreak of covid-19 resulted in the highest number of covid-19 cases and deaths in the united states. One major reason behind this is the stringency index of the United States. It is comparatively low according to the population. I also analyzed how the GDP per capita of every country was affected during the outbreak of covid-19
